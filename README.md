Province-level GDP: There is no official nominal GDP for 2016 yet. I use the current price 2015 GDP from http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&id=3840038 and then infer the 2016 levels using RBC's latest provincial outlook. Specifically, the forecast nominal GDP growth for 2016 from http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/provtbl.pdf
